This folder contains my team's final project for this class. Our team focused on analyzing customer retention for a Brazilian e-commerce company (Olist). The data we used is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce?resource=download). Our entire final project is in "final-project" notebook. I focused on creating models to better predict delivery times, as accurate delivery times are one area we identified as being important to customer satisfaction. My work is viewable in the "predicting-delivery-dates" notebook.
